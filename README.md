# Creating a Corporate Dashboard

This repository contains SQL queries used to create KPIs for a company overview dashboard. 
The project built on a relational database with data on sales, clients and employees of a mock international company. 
We worked with MySQL and integrated SQL queries (see files in this repo) in Tableau to create a dashboard.

The dashboard can be accessed on Tableau Public:

This is part of a team project at Wild Code School (Sept 2021).
